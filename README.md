## About SmartDrive

This app was built for open code challenge. Program lets user select different options to a road trip and compares different outcomes like time- and fuel consumption. Some values were stated in criteria, some you can modify from recoil-folder (src/utilities/recoilState.js).

## Technologies used:
* React (create-react-app)
* Recoil (newish state management library from Facebook team)
* Emotion (library inspired by styled-components)
* Framer Motion (animation library)
* Built using Vscode on Windows 10

## Some personal notes

* Time format: time has been formatted to show only 2 biggest units. If there are some crazy settings where a trip would take months, nobody cares about minutes and seconds - right?
* There were many 'firsts' during this project, never used Recoil, Emotion or Framer Motion -libraries before. Never built bar charts from scratch (`<meter>` wouldve done the trick but where's fun in that :-)
* Requirements for the challenge were minimal so it inspired to test new things. Emotion is one library I keep on using in future personal projects, also Recoil felt great!
